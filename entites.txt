### **Key Rules**:  
1. **Admins** have full system access.  
2. **School Admins** are restricted to their schoolâ€™s data.  
3. **Teachers** see only their assigned classes/subjects (`TeacherAssignment`).  
4. **Parents** access only their linked students (`ParentStudent`).  
5. **Students** view their own records (no edit rights).  

Would you like to add granular permissions (e.g., "Teacher can create exams but not delete them")?
